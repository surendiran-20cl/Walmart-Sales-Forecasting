# **Walmart Sales Forecasting Project**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on forecasting weekly sales for Walmart stores using different time series forecasting techniques. The goal is to predict sales for the next 12 weeks across multiple stores, helping Walmart optimize inventory management and business planning.  

## **Project Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to build and compare multiple time series forecasting models to predict future sales. This involves:  
- Understanding the sales trends and seasonality of Walmart stores.  
- Applying different forecasting techniques such as **ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.  
- Evaluating model performance using error metrics like **MAE, MSE, and RMSE**.  
- Visualizing sales trends and forecasts for better insights.  

## **Dataset Information**  
- **Source**: Walmart’s sales dataset (assumed format: CSV file).  
- **Columns**:  
  - `Store`: Store ID.  
  - `Date`: Weekly sales date.  
  - `Weekly_Sales`: Sales revenue for the week.  
  - `IsHoliday`: Indicates if the week contains a holiday.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` – Data processing  
  - `numpy` – Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
  - `statsmodels` – Time series models (Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMA)  
  - `sklearn` – Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVR)  

## **Forecasting Methods Implemented**  
### **1. Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**  
Captures trend and seasonality using additive smoothing techniques.  

### **2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
A statistical model that uses lagged observations and differencing to make forecasts.  

### **3. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**  
Enhances ARIMA by incorporating seasonality into the forecasting process.  

### **4. Random Forest Regressor**  
A machine learning approach using decision trees to predict future sales based on historical data.  

### **5. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
A regression model that finds the best fit for sales prediction using a kernel-based approach.  

## **Model Evaluation**  
The models were evaluated using:  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  

The best-performing model was selected based on **minimum RMSE**.

## **Results and Insights**  
- The SARIMA model showed the **best performance** in capturing sales trends.  
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVR) provided competitive results but required careful tuning.  
- The dataset exhibited **seasonal fluctuations**, likely due to holiday effects.  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Adding more **explanatory variables** (e.g., promotions, weather conditions).  
- Exploring **deep learning models** like LSTMs or Facebook Prophet (excluding due to complexity).  
- Using **hyperparameter tuning** for improved model accuracy.
